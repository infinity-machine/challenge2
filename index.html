        <h1 id="headline">Connor Carciofini</h1>
        <p>Connor Carciofini was born and raised in St. Paul, Minnesota. His first industrial cooking job
             was at a Pizza Luce location in the Seward neighborhood of minneapolis, where he learned
             the fundamentals of working in a volume kitchen. His next several jobs were support/middle-of-house
             positions at busy restaurants downtown, but even as a food-runner, busser, and barback, he retained
             the work ethic and hustle he'd been taught as a line cook.
