            <h1 id="headline">Restaurant Career</h1>
            <p>Since 2010 I've been paying my rent by cooking, food running, bar-backing, serving,
                and just about anything else I can get my hands on in various restaurants across
                the twin cities. The most important thing I've learned is to keep moving, 
                and never let a seemingly impossible workload slow your pace. I had no choice but
                to develop a work ethic that, in my mind, overqualifies me for just about anything else.
                Whether I'm serving 8 tables at once, or churning out a mountain of code, I do so 
                at a pace that is both careful and competetive, and I never rest until the job is done.
            </p>
